  h2 What is it?
  
  p The Great Brain is a project that sends and receives boolean data between remote servers. Each remote server the brain connects to is considered a 'node', which responds with one of the following: text, an image, audio or a video.
  
  p In this simple format, the key is to keep the code as simple as possible and vary the HTML content response as much as possible.
  
  h2 How can I contribute?
  
  p Feel free to fork any of our sample nodes below and replace with your respective content. The sample nodes are all developed in <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>, <a href="http://haml-lang.com">Haml</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>. Once you are happy with your node, deploy to a server where we can access the site. An easy place to deploy to is <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.
  
  h2 Technical Notes
  
  p This currently works best with the latest version of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/fx">Firefox</a>. It tends to crash in Chrome and Safari after a short period of time when the &lt;audio&gt; tag is involved.
