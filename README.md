# The Great Brain Project

## What it is
 
The Great Brain is an experimental project to test out a basic network system using asynchronous calls on Node.js and Express.

## How it works

Currently, the goal is to have as many contributors provide their nodes via basic API calls that send/receive either a 0 or a 1 (boolean). Depending on which value is sent to them, they return HTML content in the format of text, an image tag, a video tag or an audio tag.

## External Node Requirements

Nodes can be in any language and/or framework that the contributor wants to use - the only requirement is that they return JSONP responses for HTML content and boolean requests.

## Further Extensions

To be determined ...
